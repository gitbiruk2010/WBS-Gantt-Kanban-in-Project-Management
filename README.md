# Fitness Tracker App - Project Management Simulation

## Overview
This project is a **hypothetical application development simulation** designed to demonstrate **project management techniques** using **Work Breakdown Structure (WBS), Gantt Charts, and Kanban Boards**. The goal is to simulate task organization, dependencies, and project progress tracking.

## Project Structure
- **Work Breakdown Structure (WBS)**: Tasks are grouped into **Planning, Design, Development, Testing, Deployment, and Post-Launch** to create a logical workflow.
- **Gantt Chart**: Visual timeline showing **task durations, dependencies, and milestones**.
- **Kanban Board**: Tasks categorized into **Backlog, To-Do, In Progress, Blocked, and Completed** to monitor real-time progress.

## Key Deliverables
- **Project Scope & Objectives**
- **UI/UX Wireframes & Mockups**
- **Backend Development & API Integration**
- **Testing & Bug Fixes**
- **App Deployment & Post-Launch Updates**

## Task Prioritization
Tasks were prioritized based on **dependencies and resource constraints**, ensuring that critical components like **backend setup and authentication** were completed before dependent tasks such as **API integration** and **UI development**.

## How to Use This Repository
- View the **WBS structure** to understand task breakdown.
- Check the **Gantt Chart** for project timeline and dependencies.
- Use the **Kanban Board** to track task progress.
- Modify the project plan based on different project scenarios.

## Conclusion
This simulation showcases effective project management strategies, providing insight into **workflow planning, resource allocation, and progress tracking** for application development.
